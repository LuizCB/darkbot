Please view docs/WHATSNEW in the distribution for latest changes.

Also, keep in mind that this is a BETA non-release, and there are
probably files in the source folder that are not compiled as they
are works in progress. In this particular instance, they are
new.c, and newchanserv.c. These files affect nothing, and can be
left there and ignored safely, or removed at your discretion.
