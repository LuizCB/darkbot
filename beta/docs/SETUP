 * OUTPUT1_DELAY seconds. If queue is > OUTPUT2_COUNT,

 * and modes) The defaults below are recommended,
 * as the bot isn't going to flood off. If you are
 * having the bot delete output messages and you'd
 * like to increase the queue, update the 
 * OUTPUT_PURGE_COUNT to a larger number. Just keep
 * in mind if someone floods your bot with a lot of
 * VERSION requests, the bot will sit there outputting
